# Project
Screensharing apps currently exist for desktop platforms but there are little to no mobile apps that allow user to share their iPhone or iPad screens in realtime. The purpose of this project is to allow users to draw on their iPhones or iPads, then <i>project</i> their drawings and diagrams onto a web app. Hopefully this will make it more convenient for students working on projects remotely (like us) to collaborate with their peers. We hope to eliminate the tedious cycle of first using the camera app to take pictures of our ideas, uploading and sending them through a second app, and opening yet another app to flesh out the ideas over video chat.

## Server
To start the server,
~~~
cd websocket-demo
npm start
~~~

## iOS App
Run the App in XCode. You should get feedback from the server in the console when you connect, disconnect, and receive messages the server sends every 3 seconds.
