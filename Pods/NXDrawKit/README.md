#Purpose
It's just started for my personal app for iPhone.
Though, it can not be customized as much as you want, you can use [Smooth Freehand Drawing View](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-sdk_freehand-drawing--mobile-13164) easily.
I made `Palette` and `ToolBar` for using `Canvas`, so **you don't have to use** `Palette` and `ToolBar`.

**NXDrawKit** is a set of classes designed to use drawable view easily. 
This framework consists of 3 kinds of views.
 - `Canvas` providing redo, undo, clear, save and load image is a view  for drawing.
 - `Palette` calls delegate with color, alpha and width when user clicks the button.
 - `ToolBar` represents the features of `Canvas`, and can show the status of `Canvas`.

# Installation

## CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `NXDrawKit` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'NXDrawKit'
```

To get the full benefits import `NXDrawKit` wherever you import UIKit

``` swift
import UIKit
import NXDrawKit
```
## Carthage
Create a `Cartfile` that lists the framework and run `carthage bootstrap`. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios) to add `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/NXDrawKit.framework` to an iOS project.

```
github "nicejinux/NXDrawKit"
```
## Manually
1. Download and drop ```/NXDrawKit``` folder in your project.  
2. Congratulations!  

#Components
##Canvas 
### - Delegate
`Canvas` will call the delegate when user draw or save image.  
- Delegate provides user stroke image, background image and merged image. 
- User should provide the `Brush` to `Canvas` for drawing.

```swift
// optional
func canvas(canvas: Canvas, didUpdateDrawing drawing: Drawing, mergedImage image: UIImage?)
func canvas(canvas: Canvas, didSaveDrawing drawing: Drawing, mergedImage image: UIImage?)

// required
func brush() -> Brush?
```

### - Model

```swift
public class Drawing: NSObject {
    public var stroke: UIImage?
    public var background: UIImage?
    
    public init(stroke: UIImage? = nil, background: UIImage? = nil) {
        self.stroke = stroke
        self.background = background
    }
}

public class Brush: NSObject {
    public var color: UIColor = UIColor.blackColor()
    public var width: CGFloat = 5.0
    public var alpha: CGFloat = 1.0
}
```


### - Public Methods
 - User can set background image.
 - User can ***undo***, ***redo*** or ***clear*** the `Canvas`. (**Maximum history size is 50**)
 - User can ***save*** current stroke and background internally, then `Canvas` calls ***didSaveDrawing:*** delegate

```swift
func update(backgroundImage: UIImage?)
func undo()
func redo()
func clear()
func save() 
```

##Palette 
 - `Palette` has 12 buttons for color, 3 buttons for alpha and 4 buttons for width of brush.
 - **You can** customize color, value of alpha and width of brush with delegate, 
 - **You can't** customize number of buttons.

### - Delegate
 - `Palette` will call the delegate when user clicks the color, alpha or width button.
 - You can customize the color, alpha or width with delegate. (**all delegates are optional**)

```swift
func didChangeBrushColor(color: UIColor)
func didChangeBrushAlpha(alpha: CGFloat)
func didChangeBrushWidth(width: CGFloat)
```

 - ***tag*** can be ***1 ... 12*** 
 - If you return ***nil***, the color of tag will set with default color provided by **NXDrawKit**.
 - If you return ***clearColor()***, the color of tag will be Eraser.

```swift
func colorWithTag(tag: NSInteger) -> UIColor?
```

 - ***tag*** can be ***1 ... 3***
 - If you return ***-1***, the alpha of tag will set with default alpha provided by **NXDrawKit**.

```swift
func alphaWithTag(tag: NSInteger) -> CGFloat
```

 - ***tag*** can be ***1 ... 4***
 - If you return ***-1***, the width of tag will set with default width provided by **NXDrawKit**.

```swift
func widthWithTag(tag: NSInteger) -> CGFloat

```


### - Public Method

```swift
func currentBrush() -> Brush
```

##ToolBar
### - Public Properties
 - All buttons are set with default values without **#selector**.
 - If you want to use buttons on the `ToolBar`, you have to add **#selector** for each buttons.
```swift
var undoButton: UIButton?
var redoButton: UIButton?
var saveButton: UIButton?
var loadButton: UIButton?
var clearButton: UIButton?
```

##UIImage Extension
  - This extension can make you get **PNG** or **JPEG** format image directly for sharing or saving from what you draw.
  - All methods can return ***nil***, so you should check before use whether it's ***nil*** or not.
```swift
public extension UIImage {
    public func asPNGData() -> NSData? {
        return UIImagePNGRepresentation(self)
    }
    
    public func asJPEGData(quality: CGFloat) -> NSData? {
        return UIImageJPEGRepresentation(self, quality);
    }
    
    public func asPNGImage() -> UIImage? {
        if let data = self.asPNGData() {
            return UIImage.init(data: data)
        }
        
        return nil
    }

    public func asJPGImage(quality: CGFloat) -> UIImage? {
        if let data = self.asJPEGData(quality) {
            return UIImage.init(data: data)
        }
        
        return nil
    }
}
```
